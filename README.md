Description
-----------

Instead of the default Elgg behaviour of displaying the date of older posts as 'XX days ago' this plugin will show the posting date in 'date month year' format'. For entries younger than two weeks it will show the date in several step from 'just now' to 'last week' until 'about 2 weeks ago'.

I've included the months' names in the language file to allow for internationalization. If you want the names of the months showing in your preferred language, you can easily create the appropriate languge file on your own.


Installation
------------

1. If you have a previous version of the Enhanced Friendly Time plugin installed, first remove the old friendly_time folder from your mod directory before copying/extracting the new version to your server,
2. Copy the friendly_time folder into the mod folder of your site,
3. Enable the plugin in the admin section of your site.
